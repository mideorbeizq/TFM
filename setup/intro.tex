Before deploying our WBSN system we require a minimum knowledge about
the physiological signals we intend to monitor. The following lines
describe briefly all the signals we monitored from the patients, as
well as those other secondary parameters that we obtained from these
variables. Then, we present the system that we used to acquire the
desired variables, as well as the procedure conducted with the
patients.
