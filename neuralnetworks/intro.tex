\label{chapter:nn}

As we have mentioned in \charef{introduction}, our data mining approaches are based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
This kind of algorithm is currently the most popular data modeling method used in the medical domain because of its more than acceptable predictive performance. That is the reason why we opted in favour of ANNs for achieving  our final aim of predicting migraine crisis. 

In order to truly understand ANNs, it is necessary to have a minimum knowledge about those characteristics of brain function that have inspired the development of artificial neural networks
; \ie, how the neurons of the brain conduct themselves and interact each other.
