Since our experimental scenario considers a target output (the pain curve described in \secref{paincurve}), we have focused in the subset of supervised training algorithms. 
Next sections explained the rules of the backpropagation algorithm as well as its versions for the different architectures of ANNs described in \secref{topologies}:

\subsection{Static backpropagation algorithm}
\label{subsec:staticbackprop}

\subsection{Backpropagation through time}
\label{subsec:bptt}

\subsection{Backpropagation for spiking neural networks}
\label{subsec:snnbackprop}
