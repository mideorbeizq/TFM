Backpropagation is a gradient-descent supervised learning algorithm suitable for both static and dynamic ANNs. 
Next sections explained the rules of the backpropagation algorithm as well as its versions for the different architectures of ANNs described in \secref{topologies}:

\subsection{Static backpropagation algorithm}
\label{subsec:staticbackprop}

\subsection{Backpropagation through time}
\label{subsec:bptt}

\subsection{Backpropagation for spiking neural networks}
\label{subsec:snnbackprop}
