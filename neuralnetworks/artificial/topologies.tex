\label{sec:topologies}

There is a wide set of ANNs architectures.
Since our final aim is to forecast a time series,
the following sections are focused on those network topologies suitable for this purpose. 
Nonetheless, in order to better understand the building process of each architecture, we explain firstly the \emph{Perceptron} topology, which is the simplest structure.
