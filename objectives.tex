In   order   to  achieve  the  final  aim, \ie,  the  early  prediction  of  migraine  attack  for  an  effective medical treatment, the next specific goals are established: 
 
\begin{itemize} 
\item[A.] Study of the theoretical background of several data mining algorithms suitable for time series analysis.

\item[B.] Implementation of the above algorithms.

\item[C.] Analysis of the influence of the params that define such algorithms.

\item[D.] Comparison of the suitability of each developed algorithm for the migraine scenario presented.

\end{itemize}
